What are negative indexes and why are they used? 

Negative indexes:-Use negative indexes to start the slice from the end of the string.

-When you use a negative index, youâ€™re essentially counting from the end of the sequence.
-The last element has an index of -1, the second-to-last element has an index of -2, and so on.

example:- list=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
          print(list[-1])
          print(list[:-2])

output:-[6]
      :-[1,2,3,4]
